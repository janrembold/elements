## Writing unit tests

Whenever you create or edit a React component or any other JavaScript file, you must update or create a corresponding test file in the same directory.

By convention the test file should be named after the file's name with an additional `.test.` part:

```sh
SomeDir
  | - MyButton.jsx
  | - MyButton.test.jsx
```

```sh
SomeOtherDir
  | - utils.js
  | - utils.test.js
```

To manually trigger the unit tests, run:

```sh
yarn test:unit
```

You can also use the corresponding watch task:

```sh
yarn watch:test:unit
```

The unit tests are performed using the [Jest platform](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), please refer to its documentation.

React component testing is based on the [Enzyme testing utility](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/), please refer to its documentation.

The use of snapshots generated by the `toMatchSnapshot()` method is strongly encouraged. [Those snapshots must be always commited as they are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)
